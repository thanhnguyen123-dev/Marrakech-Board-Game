### Comments 
Good features:

- Sufficient comments for each case, docString is well-documented
- Conditional branches are clear and easy to understand
- Good use of object-oriented programming
- Cover every case of the task

What can be improved:
- Each line should not exceed 80 characters
- Separate space between each conditional branches to improve code readability
- Introduce variables, eg. Rug rugColour = rug.getColour
