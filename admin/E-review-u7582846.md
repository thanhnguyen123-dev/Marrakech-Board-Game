### Comments

Good features:
1. 'highlightNearestInvisibleRug' method help players better view, which provides a good visual interaction effect
2. The code is well-documented
3. The size of each method is appropriate
4. Methods and variables are named appropriately, with high readability

What can be improved:
1. Lack of comments and javadoc, it's hard to read
2. Each line should not be too long
